# Software-Tutorials
Written tutorials for the use of softwares. With an attempt to be as accessible as possible.
  Due to a scarcity of good tutorials friendly to non tech users, the repository has been created to host written tutorials.
When discussing topics (such as emulation, the sensitive topic it is), there will be **no** instructions on committing crimes within the United States.

  An attempt will be made to write all tutorials in simple gramattically correct American English, unless editors provide different english tutorials.
